  Description:
    Purpose: The NED is a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data.  One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. The datasets are utilized by the scientific and reso

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Service Center Agencies should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data.

    This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source.  This information may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application.  Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Service Center Agencies any authority for the decisions that they make.  The Service Center Agencies will not perform any evaluations of these data for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

    Photographic or digital enlargement of these data to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data.  Digital data files are periodically updated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The USGS delivers folders of .tif files NGCE via disk where it is loaded into Raster Mosaics. An index map  of one degree  quads is used to  extract for the Gateway.
The extract uses cubic convolution resampling to reproject the data from geographic to UTM.
